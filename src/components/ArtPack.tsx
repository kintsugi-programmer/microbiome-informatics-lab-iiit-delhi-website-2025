// A 2D digital illustration of a cute, friendly gut microbe character designed for kids. The microbe has a soft, bean-like shape with a vibrant pastel blue body, big round eyes, a small smiling mouth, and tiny stubby arms. It has a fuzzy texture like felt, with a subtle shine to give it depth. The character is floating on a white background, with no shadows or background elements. The style is minimalist, cartoonish, and highly appealing to children, similar to modern educational animation characters
