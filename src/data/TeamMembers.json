    "bio": "I am a computational microbiologist focussing on the human microbiome. Using a combination of publicly available data as well as in-house generated microbiome data from specific India sub-populations, I aim to use a range of data-driven statistical, machine-learning and deep learning-based approaches to unearth the basis of resilience, assembly and stability of the human microbiome, investigate the basis of the inter-personal variability of the microbiome and utilize these insights to formulate and propose data-driven personalized and/or sub-population-level microbiome-targeted/microbiome-derived diagnostics and therapeutics. I have spearheaded a range of studies focusing on the role of gut microbiome in aging and life-style; interaction between disease-associated and aging-associated microbiome changes and; the most importantly the role of the gut microbiome as a transducer in modulating the role of a healthy diet on different aspects of host clinical phenotypes like frailty, improved cognition and behaviour.
