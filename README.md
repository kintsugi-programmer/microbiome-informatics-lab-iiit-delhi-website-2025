# Microbiome-Informatics-Lab-IIIT-Delhi-Website-2025
We are developing the official website for the Microbiome Informatics Lab at IIIT Delhi as a digital extension of the FMT Hub. The platform is being built using Next.js 15, React 19, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript, focusing on modular UI, SEO, and responsiveness. Weâ€™re implementing secure APIs, dynamic routing, and scalable backend architecture for seamless performance. Deployment is handled on Oracle Linux with Apache, using SSL-secured HTTPS. This site will serve as a centralized digital gateway for lab research, data resources, and collaborations.

## Introduction
We are currently building the official website for the Microbiome Informatics Lab at IIIT Delhi, as a natural extension of our previous work on the FMT Hub. This project aims to establish a unified and professional digital presence for the lab, integrating research insights, personnel, publications, and data tools into a modern, performant web platform.
The development stack includes Next.js 15, React 19, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript, with a focus on modular UI design, SEO optimization, and cross-device responsiveness. We're engineering dynamic routing, secure API endpoints, and scalable backend architecture to ensure smooth frontend-backend communication and future-proof extensibility. The deployment is being handled on Oracle Linux servers with Apache, using SSL-secured custom HTTPS for encrypted connections.
In this phase, we are focusing on:
- Creating reusable component libraries for consistent lab branding.
- Building user-centric interfaces that highlight lab research, team profiles, and live updates.
- Integrating the FMT Hub data layer for seamless navigation between resources.
- Ensuring performance and accessibility compliance through Lighthouse audits and testing.

This project will serve as a centralized hub for collaborators, researchers, and external stakeholders, significantly elevating the visibility and digital maturity of the Microbiome Informatics Lab.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

To deploy your statically exported **Next.js site (with `output: 'export'`)** to **GitHub Pages**, follow this clean and battle-tested setup:

---

## âœ… Step-by-Step GitHub Pages Deployment for `next export`

### 1. **Pre-requisites**

* Your project must be **using `output: 'export'`** in `next.config.js`
* Your Git repo must be initialized and pushed to GitHub

---

### 2. **Install `gh-pages`**

```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

---

### 3. **Update `next.config.js`**

You **must set the base path and asset prefix** if your repo is not hosted at the root domain:

```js
// next.config.js
const repoName = 'your-repo-name'; // CHANGE THIS to your GitHub repo name

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  basePath: `/${repoName}`,
  assetPrefix: `/${repoName}/`
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

---

### 4. **Update `package.json`**

#### Add `homepage` key:

```json
"homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name",
```

#### Add scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build && next export",
  "start": "npx serve out",
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d out"
}
```

---

### 5. **Build and Deploy**

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will:

* Build and export the static site to `/out`
* Push the contents of `/out` to the `gh-pages` branch of your repo

---

### 6. **Enable GitHub Pages in Repo Settings**

* Go to your repo on GitHub â†’ **Settings** â†’ **Pages**
* Source: select `gh-pages` branch, then `/ (root)`
* Wait a few seconds, and your site will be live at:

  ```
  https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/
  ```

---

## ðŸ§  Tip: Automate it

If you want to run everything in one go:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Thatâ€™s it! Let me know if you want this to also work with a **custom domain** or need a `CNAME` file setup.

not-found.tsx

    "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build && next export",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint",
    "export": "next export",
    "meow": "npm i && next dev",
  "meowmeow": "npm run build && npx serve@latest out"


for handling
Error: "next start" does not work with "output: export" configuration. Use "npx serve@latest out" instead.
